"""
CommandGateway — context-aware rehydration + exfiltration control.

The gateway sits between the LLM and local execution. It:
  * receives an LLM-generated raw command or a structured tool call,
  * detects placeholders and validates they are allowed *in that position*,
  * rehydrates placeholders only in approved argument positions,
  * blocks unsafe usage (exfiltration, echo/print, sending values to arbitrary
    external endpoints),
  * hands back a real command for local execution,
  * re-sanitizes stdout/stderr before results go back to the LLM.

Rehydration is deliberately NOT a naive global string replace: a placeholder is
only turned back into its real value after the surrounding shell context has
been proven safe, and only for placeholder tokens known to the session vault.
